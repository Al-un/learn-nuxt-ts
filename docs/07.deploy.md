## Deployment

### Universal vs Pre-rendered vs SPA

Nuxt offers three different ways to "build" our application
(more on [Nuxt docs](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/commands#production-deployment)):

- Universal, serving our app as an Node application
- Pre-rendered, serving our app as a static website but with all routes pre-rendered
- SPA, serving our app as a SPA website

I will not use SPA here as pre-rendered does all the hard work to generate all routes
for us, which is one of SPA weakness.

To deploy an universal build:

```sh
yarn build
yarn start
```

To deploy a pre-rendered build:

```sh
yarn generate
# deploy /dist/ folder
```

You will find relevant documentation on [NuxtJS FAQ](https://nuxtjs.org/faq/). I have tested
some deployments for my personal usage so I will cover these in the following paragraphs.

### Surge

[Surge](https://surge.sh/) is a very easy to use static website hosting accessible via
CLI only, which is quite cool for continuous deployment.

Install Surge:

```sh
# Install globally
npm install --global surge
# Add locally as a devDependency
yarn add --dev surge
```

> For some reasons, I could not install Surge globally with yarn

Then simply build and deploy a static website:

```sh
# Generate
yarn generate
# Deploy
surge --project ./dist/
```

Output:

```sh

   Running as xxxx@xxxx.xxx (Student)

        project: ./dist/
         domain: lively-quiver.surge.sh
         upload: [====================] 100% eta: 0.0s (12 files, 256921 bytes)
            CDN: [====================] 100%
             IP: 45.55.110.124

   Success! - Published to lively-quiver.surge.sh
```

That's it!

### AWS S3

S3 bucket offers the possibility to host a static website ([AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html)):

- Go to your AWS management console
- Create a S3 bucket and open it
- Go to properties and enable _Static website hosting_
- Make your bucket public by adding this _permissions > bucket policy_:

  ```json
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Sid": "AddPerm",
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": "*",
        "Action": "s3:GetObject",
        "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::nuxt-ts/*"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

- Upload your _dist/_ content into your bucket

For those who prefer to use AWS CLI:

```sh
# Create your bucket. Replace "nuxt-ts" with your bucket name
aws s3 mb s3://nuxt-ts
# Enable static website hosting with default values
aws s3 website s3://nuxt-ts --index-document index.html --error-document error.html
# Create a bucket policy files
touch s3_policy.json
# Edit accordingly. Use VS Code!
vim s3_policy.json
# Apply policy file to bucket
aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket nuxt-ts --policy file://s3_policy.json
# Generate and upload dist/ content
yarn generate
aws s3 cp dist/ s3://nuxt-ts --recursive
# Tadaa!!
firefox nuxt-ts.s3-website.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com
```

### Heroku

Configure first your _package.json_. By convention, Nuxt uses `build` and `start`
scripts which is properly triggered by Heroku after a `git push`. For the sake of
the tutorial, let's use Heroku specific hooks in _package.json_:

```json
"scripts": {
    "build": "nuxt build", // this will not run
    "heroku-postbuild": "nuxt build", // this will run instead
    "start": "nuxt start" // this will run after a successful build
  }
```

```sh
# == no app == : create app
heroku create nuxt-ts
# == app exists ==: add remote
heroku git:remote --app nuxt-ts
# check your remotes
git remote -v
# configure your app
heroku config:set NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION=false --app nuxt-ts
heroku config:set HOST=0.0.0.0 --app nuxt-ts
heroku config:set NODE_ENV=production --app nuxt-ts
# simply push your desired branch to Heroku
git push heroku master
```

- [Using Heroku CLI to deploy](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git#creating-a-heroku-remote)

### Travis CI

Thanks to providers, including those deployment into Travis is easy.
Please check [_.travis.yml_](https://github.com/Al-un/learn-nuxt-ts/blob/master/.travis.yml) for
the complete configuration file.

When encrypting values, I prefer to copy paste the secured values into
my _.travis.yml_ rather than having the CLI doing it for me because
it sometimes breaks my formatting.

#### Surge

Configure Surge:

```sh
# Generate a token
surge token
# Encrypt SURGE_LOGIN
travis encrypt "SURGE_LOGIN={your email}" --com -r {your Github user}/{your repo}
# Encrypt SURGE_TOKEN
travis encrypt "SURGE_TOKEN={your token}" --com -r {your Github user}/{your repo}
```

Then add a Surge provider to your _.travis.yml_:

```yaml
deploy:
  - provider: surge
    project: ./dist
    domain: nuxt-ts.surge.sh # optional
    skip-cleanup: true
```

Please check [Travis docs](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/surge/) for more.

#### AWS S3

Similary to Surge, encrypt your _AccessKeyId_ and your _SecretAccessKey_. Then add the
S3 provider:

```yaml
deploy:
  - provider: s3
    access_key_id:
      secure: '...'
    secret_access_key:
      secure: '...'
    bucket: nuxt-ts
    region: eu-west-3
    skip-cleanup: true
    local_dir: dist
```

Don't forget to specify the bucket region and the folder (`local_dir`) to upload

Please check [Travis docs](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/s3/) for more.

#### Heroku

Encrypt your Heroku API key and add the Heroku provider:

```yaml
deploy:
  - provider: heroku
    api_key: secure: '...'
    app: nuxt-ts
    on:
      branch: master
      node_js: node
```

Please check [Travis docs](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/heroku/) for more.

### Circle CI

When Travis is using _providers_, Circle CI uses _Orbs_. I will not
focus on Circle CI orbs in this tutorial. Please check
[_.circleci/config.yml_](https://github.com/Al-un/learn-nuxt-ts/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml)
for the complete configuration

#### Surge

As mentioned earlier, you can either install Surge globally or as a _devDependency_.
Having `SURGE_LOGIN` and `SURGE_TOKEN` environment variables defined, it is as
simple as executing the `surge` command:

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy-surge:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/node:11-browsers-legacy
    working_directory: ~/repo
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run generate
      - run: ./node_modules/.bin/surge --project ~/repo/dist --domain nuxt-ts.surge.sh
```

Reference: [Surge doc](https://surge.sh/help/integrating-with-circleci)

#### AWS S3

Circle CI offers a [S3 orb](https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/circleci/aws-s3)
to ease S3 deployment, especially regarding AWS CLI configuration. Three environments
variables are needed:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `AWS_REGION`

Then, add the orb and execute it in a job:

```yaml
orbs:
  aws-s3: circleci/aws-s3@1.0.4

jobs:
  deploy-s3:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/python:2.7
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run generate
      - aws-s3/copy:
          from: ~/repo/dist
          to: 's3://nuxt-ts'
          arguments: '--recursive'
```

Reference: [Circle CI doc](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/deployment-integrations/#aws)

#### Heroku

Configure first required environment variables:

- `HEROKU_API_KEY`
- `HEROKU_APP_NAME`

Once done, deploying to Heroku is a simple `git push`:

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy-heroku:
    docker:
      - image: buildpack-deps:trusty
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Deploy Master to Heroku
          command: |
            git push https://heroku:$HEROKU_API_KEY@git.heroku.com/$HEROKU_APP_NAME.git master
```
